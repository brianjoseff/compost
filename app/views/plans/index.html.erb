  <h4> I will collect your compost and dispose of it</h4>
  <div class="intro"><p>Last year, my roommates and I got a compost bin for our Fahey dorm room, and we immediately reduced our landfill waste to near zero by composting instead of trashing the random fruit pieces, old pizza, mysteries in the mini fridge, paper towels, string, etcâ€¦ that were constantly cropping up in our room. With your waste stream being converted back into soil, and the smells of rotting trash banished, the only problem is getting the compost out of your dorm room. That's where "Dos Compost" enters the scene, stage right.</p>
  <p>This is a compost retrieval service. Cutting your waste is as simple as answering two questions: 1. Do you want your compost picked up once or twice a week? 2. Do you want to buy your own compost bin through me or pay higher weekly fees to borrow one?</p></div>
