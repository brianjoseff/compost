  .intro
    %p Once upon a time, three roommates got a compost bin for their Fahey dorm room, and immediately reduced their landfill waste to near zero by composting instead of trashing the random fruit pieces, old pizza, mysteries in the mini fridge, paper towels, string, etcâ€¦ that were constantly cropping up in their room. With their waste stream being converted back into soil, and the smells of rotting trash banished, the only problem was getting the compost out of their dorm room. That's where "Dos Compost" enters the scene, stage right.
    %p We will give you a metal, odor-less compost bin for you to put your compostable items in, and we will come by and pick it up, then dispose of it for you.
  %p Do it for the kids.
