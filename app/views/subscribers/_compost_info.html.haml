%p This is the Norpro 1 Gallon Stainless Steel Compost bin. I have been using it since last winter and it works great. There is no odor, and it is easily washable. It is $37.29 on Amazon, the cheapest price available, but I can get it, just for you, for $30. If you already have a bin, click the check box below.</p>
